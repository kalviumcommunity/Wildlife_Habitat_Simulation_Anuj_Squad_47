# Wildlife_Habitat_Simulation_Anuj_Squad_47

# I am building this project as part of my academic. I have to implement the OOPS concepts.

## Project Description:

The project simulates a wildlife habitat where different animals coexist in a shared environment. 
It will include various species like herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores that interact with each other and their surroundings.
Each species will have its own behaviors, such as hunting, eating, sleeping, and moving around the habitat. 
The simulation will include seasons and day-night cycles that affect the animals' activities.
Over time, the animalsâ€™ populations will fluctuate depending on food availability, predator-prey relationships, and environmental conditions.

## Features to Implement

### Animal Classes: Different animals (e.g., lions, deer, bears) with unique behaviors.
### Environment Class: The habitat with conditions like weather, seasons, and terrain.
### Day-Night Cycle: A system that simulates time passing, affecting animals' activity.
### Interactions: Carnivores hunt herbivores, herbivores eat plants, and all animals have lifespans.
### Population Control: Birth and death rates that depend on food availability and predators.
### Events: Random events like droughts or floods that affect animal populations and behaviors.
